# HealthBot_LangGraph

Context: I completed this guided programming exercise as a part of the Udacity course titled AI Agents with LangChain and LangGraph.

In the Jupyter notebook, an agentic workflow is defined, compiled, and executed within the LangGraph framework. The workflow is an AI-powered chatbot that can provide personalised, on-demand health information to patients. It takes a patient's query, searches the web, provides a summary, designs a comprehension check quiz, and evaluates the patient's response.

In config.env, you must provide your own API keys.
